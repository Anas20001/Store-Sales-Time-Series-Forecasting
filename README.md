# Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

We’ll use time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporation Favorite, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.

## Description

Specifically, We’ll build a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores. We’ll practice our machine learning skills with an approachable training dataset of dates, store, and item information, promotions, and unit sales.

## Context 

Forecasts aren’t just for meteorologists. Governments forecast economic growth. Scientists attempt to predict the future population. And businesses forecast product demand—a common task of professional data scientists. Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting, thanks to machine learning, could help ensure retailers please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.

Current subjective forecasting methods for retail have little data to back them up and are unlikely to be automated. The problem becomes even more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever-transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing.
